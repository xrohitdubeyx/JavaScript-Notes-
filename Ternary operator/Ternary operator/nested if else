Embedding If Statement inside another IF Statement called JavaScript Nested If Statement. 
The JavaScript Else Statement allows us to print different statements depending upon the expression result (TRUE, FALSE).
Sometimes we have to check even further when the condition is TRUE.
In this situation, we can use the Nested IF statement, but be careful while using it.

nested if else 

let winNumber = 26  
let guessNumber = prompt("guess a number");

if(guessNumber == winNumber){
    console.log("your guess is right");
}
else{
    if(guessNumber > winNumber){
        console.log("your guess is too hight");
    }
    else{
        console.log("your guess is too low");
    }
}
